This task has characteristics that (i) each commentary is only partially aligned with events, (ii) play event data contains many types of categorical and numerical attributes, (iii) live commentaries often mention player names and team names. For these reasons, we propose an encoder for play event data, which is enhanced with a gate mechanism. We also introduce an attention mechanism on events. In addition, we introduced placeholders and their reconstruction mechanism to enable the model to copy appropriate player names and team names from the input data. We conduct experiments on the play data of the English Premier League, provide a discussion on the result including generated commentaries.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GOAL: A Challenging Knowledge-grounded Video Captioning Benchmark for Real-time Soccer Commentary Generation</title><link>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/goal-a-challenging-knowledge-grounded-video-captioning-benchmark-for-real-time-soccer-commentary-generation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/goal-a-challenging-knowledge-grounded-video-captioning-benchmark-for-real-time-soccer-commentary-generation/</guid><description>&lt;p>Despite the recent emergence of video captioning models, how to generate vivid, fine-grained video descriptions based on the background knowledge (i.e., long and informative commentary about the domain-specific scenes with appropriate reasoning) is still far from being solved, which however has great applications such as automatic sports narrative. Based on soccer game videos and synchronized commentary data, we present GOAL, a benchmark of over 8.9k soccer video clips, 22k sentences, and 42k knowledge triples for proposing a challenging new task setting as Knowledge-grounded Video Captioning (KGVC). We experimentally test existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on this resource to demonstrate the future directions for improvement in this challenging task. We hope that our data resource (now available at &lt;a href="https://github.com/THU-KEG/goal">https://github.com/THU-KEG/goal&lt;/a>) can serve researchers and developers interested in knowledge-grounded cross-modal applications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MatchTime: Towards Automatic Soccer Game Commentary Generation</title><link>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/matchtime-towards-automatic-soccer-game-commentary-generation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/matchtime-towards-automatic-soccer-game-commentary-generation/</guid><description>&lt;p>Soccer is a globally popular sport with a vast audience, in this paper, we consider constructing an automatic soccer game commentary model to improve the audiences&amp;rsquo; viewing experience. In general, we make the following contributions: &lt;em>First&lt;/em>, observing the prevalent video-text misalignment in existing datasets, we manually annotate timestamps for 49 matches, establishing a more robust benchmark for soccer game commentary generation, termed as &lt;em>SN-Caption-test-align&lt;/em>; &lt;em>Second&lt;/em>, we propose a multi-modal temporal alignment pipeline to automatically correct and filter the existing dataset at scale, creating a higher-quality soccer game commentary dataset for training, denoted as &lt;em>MatchTime&lt;/em>; &lt;em>Third&lt;/em>, based on our curated dataset, we train an automatic commentary generation model, named &lt;strong>MatchVoice&lt;/strong>. Extensive experiments and ablation studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of our alignment pipeline, and training model on the curated datasets achieves state-of-the-art performance for commentary generation, showcasing that better alignment can lead to significant performance improvements in downstream tasks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scaling up SoccerNet with Multi-view Spatial Localization and Re-identification</title><link>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/scaling-up-soccernet-with-multi-view-spatial-localization-and-re-identification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/scaling-up-soccernet-with-multi-view-spatial-localization-and-re-identification/</guid><description>&lt;p>Soccer videos are a rich playground for computer vision, involving many elements, such as players, lines, and specific objects. Hence, to capture the richness of this sport and allow for fine automated analyses, we release SoccerNet-v3, a major extension of the SoccerNet dataset, providing a wide variety of spatial annotations and cross-view correspondences. SoccerNet’s broadcast videos contain replays of important actions, allowing us to retrieve a same action from different viewpoints. We annotate those live and replay action frames showing same moments with exhaustive local information. Specifically, we label lines, goal parts, players, referees, teams, salient objects, jersey numbers, and we establish player correspondences between the views. This yields 1,324,732 annotations on 33,986 soccer images, making SoccerNet-v3 the largest dataset for multi-view soccer analysis. Derived tasks may benefit from these annotations, like camera calibration, player localization, team discrimination and multi-view re-identification, which can further sustain practical applications in augmented reality and soccer analytics. Finally, we provide Python codes to easily download our data and access our annotations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SOCCER: An Information-Sparse Discourse State Tracking Collection in the Sports Commentary Domain</title><link>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/soccer-an-information-sparse-discourse-state-tracking-collection-in-the-sports-commentary-domain/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/soccer-an-information-sparse-discourse-state-tracking-collection-in-the-sports-commentary-domain/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the pursuit of natural language understanding, there has been a long standing interest in tracking state changes throughout narratives. Impressive progress has been made in modeling the state of transaction-centric dialogues and procedural texts. However, this problem has been less intensively studied in the realm of general discourse where ground truth descriptions of states may be loosely defined and state changes are less densely distributed over utterances. This paper proposes to turn to simplified, fully observable systems that show some of these properties: Sports events. We curated 2,263 soccer matches including time-stamped natural language commentary accompanied by discrete events such as a team scoring goals, switching players or being penalized with cards. We propose a new task formulation where, given paragraphs of commentary of a game at different timestamps, the system is asked to recognize the occurrence of in-game events. This domain allows for rich descriptions of state while avoiding the complexities of many other real-world settings. As an initial point of performance measurement, we include two baseline methods from the perspectives of sentence classification with temporal dependence and current state-of-the-art generative model, respectively, and demonstrate that even sophisticated existing methods struggle on the state tracking task when the definition of state broadens or non-event chatter becomes prevalent.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SoccerNet-Caption: Dense Video Captioning for Soccer Broadcasts Commentaries</title><link>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/soccernet-caption-dense-video-captioning-for-soccer-broadcasts-commentaries/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/soccernet-caption-dense-video-captioning-for-soccer-broadcasts-commentaries/</guid><description>&lt;p>Soccer is more than just a game - it is a passion that transcends borders and unites people worldwide. From the roar of the crowds to the excitement of the commentators, every moment of a soccer match is a thrill. Yet, with so many games happening simultaneously, fans cannot watch them all live. Notifications for main actions can help, but lack the engagement of live commentary, leaving fans feeling disconnected. To fulfill this need, we propose in this paper a novel task of dense video captioning focusing on the generation of textual commentaries anchored with single times-tamps. To support this task, we additionally present a challenging dataset consisting of almost 37k timestamped commentaries across 715.9 hours of soccer broadcast videos. Additionally, we propose a first benchmark and baseline for this task, highlighting the difficulty of temporally anchoring commentaries yet showing the capacity to generate meaningful commentaries. By providing broadcasters with a tool to summarize the content of their video with the same level of engagement as a live game, our method could help satisfy the needs of the numerous fans who follow their team but cannot necessarily watch the live game. We believe our method has the potential to enhance the accessibility and understanding of soccer content for a wider audience, bringing the excitement of the game to more people.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SoccerNet-Echoes: A Soccer Game Audio Commentary Dataset</title><link>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/soccernet-echoes-a-soccer-game-audio-commentary-dataset/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/soccernet-echoes-a-soccer-game-audio-commentary-dataset/</guid><description>&lt;p>The application of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology in soccer enables sports analytics by extracting audio commentaries to provide insights into game events and facilitate automatic game understanding. This paper presents SoccerNet-Echoes, an extension of the SoccerNet dataset with automatically generated transcriptions of soccer game broadcasts. Generated using the Whisper model and translated with Google Translate into English when needed, these transcriptions enhance video content with textual information derived from game audio. SoccerNet-Echoes serves as a comprehensive resource for developing algorithms in action spotting, caption generation, and game summarization. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that combining modalities—audio, video, and text—yields mixed results on classification tasks. The combination of audio and video shows improved performance over individual modalities, while the addition of ASR text does not significantly enhance results. Additionally, our baseline summarization tasks indicate that ASR content enriches summaries, offering insights beyond event information. This multimodal dataset supports diverse applications, broadening the scope of research in sports analytics.

In this work, we propose SoccerNet-v2, a novel large-scale corpus of manual annotations for the SoccerNet [24] video dataset, along with open challenges to encourage more research in soccer understanding and broadcast production. Specifically, we release around 300k annotations within SoccerNet’s 500 untrimmed broadcast soccer videos. We extend current tasks in the realm of soccer to include action spotting, camera shot segmentation with boundary detection, and we define a novel replay grounding task. For each task, we provide and discuss benchmark results, reproducible with our open-source adapted implementations of the most relevant works in the field. SoccerNet-v2 is presented to the broader research community to help push computer vision closer to automatic solutions for more general video understanding and production purposes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SoccerNet: A Scalable Dataset for Action Spotting in Soccer Videos</title><link>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/soccernet-a-scalable-dataset-for-action-spotting-in-soccer-videos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/soccernet-a-scalable-dataset-for-action-spotting-in-soccer-videos/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this paper, we introduce SoccerNet, a benchmark for action spotting in soccer videos. The dataset is composed of 500 complete soccer games from six main European leagues, covering three seasons from 2014 to 2017 and a total duration of 764 hours. A total of 6,637 temporal annotations are automatically parsed from online match reports at a one minute resolution for three main classes of events (Goal, Yellow/Red Card, and Substitution). As such, the dataset is easily scalable. These annotations are manually refined to a one second resolution by anchoring them at a single timestamp following well-defined soccer rules. With an average of one event every 6.9 minutes, this dataset focuses on the problem of localizing very sparse events within long videos. We define the task of spotting as finding the anchors of soccer events in a video. Making use of recent developments in the realm of generic action recognition and detection in video, we provide strong baselines for detecting soccer events. We show that our best model for classifying temporal segments of length one minute reaches a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 67.8%. For the spotting task, our baseline reaches an Average-mAP of 49.7% for tolerances d ranging from 5 to 60 seconds.

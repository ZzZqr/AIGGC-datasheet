However, generating detailed video descriptions that incorporate domain-specific information remains an unsolved challenge, holding significant research and application value, particularly in domains such as sports commentary generation. Moreover, sports event commentary goes beyond being a mere game report, it involves entertaining, metaphorical, and emotional descriptions. To promote the field of sports commentary automatic generation, in this paper, we introduce a novel dataset, the Basketball Highlight Commentary (BH-Commentary), comprising approximately 4K basketball highlight videos with groundtruth commentaries from professional commentators. In addition, we propose an end-to-end framework as a benchmark for basketball highlight commentary generation task, in which a lightweight and effective prompt strategy is designed to enhance alignment fusion among visual and textual features. Experimental results on the BH-Commentary dataset demonstrate the validity of the dataset and the effectiveness of the proposed benchmark for sports highlight commentary generation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Automated Cricket Commentary Generation</title><link>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/a-hybrid-deep-learning-model-for-automated-cricket-commentary-generation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/a-hybrid-deep-learning-model-for-automated-cricket-commentary-generation/</guid><description>&lt;p>The paper proposes an innovative method for generating cricket commentary. A hybrid model is proposed that combines three types of neural networks: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image processing, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequential text generation, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for semantic understanding. By integrating these components, the model can generate ball-by-ball commentary that is coherent and contextaware. The model works by processing video frames from a cricket match using CNN. The resulting feature maps are used to retain essential visual information. Fully connected layers transform the features to a format suitable for input into the LSTM. The LSTM generates one word at a time, considering the temporal dependencies inherent in ball-by-ball events. To enhance the semantic understanding between the generated captions, the GCN is used. Evaluation metrics like BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE are used to assess the proficiency of the model.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automated cricket commentary generation using deep learning</title><link>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/automated-cricket-commentary-generation-using-deep-learning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/automated-cricket-commentary-generation-using-deep-learning/</guid><description>&lt;p>This work presents an automated and novel system for cricket commentary generation by the introduction of event driven approach and image captioning features. The presented system uses artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) based methods to investigate real-time match data and generate real-time commentary by Image Captioning technique. For this purpose, deep neural network-based models and digital image processing techniques are used to detect the significant moments in the real-time match and generate commentary based on these real-time match events. The proposed method has been assessed using a dataset of 2 hours live cricket matches of India and England. After processing the match video, it has been observed that the developed model is successfully able to generate high-quality real-time commentary with a significant amount of accuracy. By commissioning leading-edge deep neural network-based model, the developed model determines the fitness to generate subtitles that are not only precise but also contextually appropriate, and efficiently apprehending the essence of the input frames.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automated Story Selection for Color Commentary in Sports</title><link>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/automated-story-selection-for-color-commentary-in-sports/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/automated-story-selection-for-color-commentary-in-sports/</guid><description>&lt;p>Automated sports commentary is a form of automated narrative. Sports commentary exists to keep the viewer informed and entertained. One way to entertain the viewer is by telling brief stories relevant to the game in progress. We present a system called the sports commentary recommendation system (SCoReS) that can automatically suggest stories for commentators to tell during games. Through several user studies, we compared commentary using SCoReS to three other types of commentary and show that SCoReS adds significantly to the broadcast across several enjoyment metrics. We also collected interview data from professional sports commentators who positively evaluated a demonstration of the system. We conclude that SCoReS can be a useful broadcast tool, effective at selecting stories that add to the enjoyment and watchability of sports.

Automatic commentary generation of cricket videos take advantage of aforementioned intelligent techniques. VGG-16 network facilitates extraction of visual pattern from frames followed by encoder-decoder LSTM model. Proposed model can handle variable length input data to output variable number of sequential output. Moreover, the model has ability to encompass temporal information to predict the line and length bowled by bowler, the shot selection of batsman and outcome of the ball. Due to unavailability of cricket commentary dataset, a novel cricket commentary dataset containing video-commentary pairs is presented. Evaluation is also performed on benchmark video captioning datasets which are Microsoft Video Description Dataset (MSVD) and MSR - Video to Text dataset (MSRVTT). Captions generated by our model are evaluated on video captioning metrics which are METEOR, BLEU, ROGUE L and CIDEr and outperforms the baseline model.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fine-Grained Video Captioning via Graph-based Multi-Granularity Interaction Learning</title><link>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/fine-grained-video-captioning-via-graph-based-multi-granularity-interaction-learning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/fine-grained-video-captioning-via-graph-based-multi-granularity-interaction-learning/</guid><description>&lt;p>Learning to generate continuous linguistic descriptions for multi-subject interactive videos in great details has particular applications in team sports auto-narrative. In contrast to traditional video caption, this task is more challenging as it requires simultaneous modeling of fine-grained individual actions, uncovering of spatio-temporal dependency structures of frequent group interactions, and then accurate mapping of these complex interaction details into long and detailed commentary. To explicitly address these challenges, we propose a novel framework &lt;italic>Graph-based Learning for Multi-Granularity Interaction Representation (GLMGIR)&lt;/italic> for fine-grained team sports auto-narrative task. A multi-granular interaction modeling module is proposed to extract among-subjectsâ€™ interactive actions in a progressive way for encoding both intra- and inter-team interactions. Based on the above multi-granular representations, a multi-granular attention module is developed to consider action/event descriptions of multiple spatio-temporal resolutions. Both modules are integrated seamlessly and work in a collaborative way to generate the final narrative. In the meantime, to facilitate reproducible research, we collect a new video dataset from &lt;italic>YouTube.com&lt;/italic> called Sports Video Narrative dataset (SVN). It is a novel direction as it contains &lt;inline-formula>&lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX">$6K$&lt;/tex-math>&lt;alternatives>&lt;a href="mml:math">mml:math&lt;/a>&lt;a href="mml:mrow">mml:mrow&lt;/a>&lt;a href="mml:mn">mml:mn&lt;/a>6&amp;lt;/mml:mn&amp;gt;&lt;a href="mml:mi">mml:mi&lt;/a>K&amp;lt;/mml:mi&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/mml:mrow&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/mml:math&amp;gt;&lt;inline-graphic xlink:href="zhuang-ieq1-2946823.gif"/>&lt;/alternatives>&lt;/inline-formula> team sports videos (i.e., NBA basketball games) with &lt;inline-formula>&lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX">$10K$&lt;/tex-math>&lt;alternatives>&lt;a href="mml:math">mml:math&lt;/a>&lt;a href="mml:mrow">mml:mrow&lt;/a>&lt;a href="mml:mn">mml:mn&lt;/a>10&amp;lt;/mml:mn&amp;gt;&lt;a href="mml:mi">mml:mi&lt;/a>K&amp;lt;/mml:mi&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/mml:mrow&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/mml:math&amp;gt;&lt;inline-graphic xlink:href="zhuang-ieq2-2946823.gif"/>&lt;/alternatives>&lt;/inline-formula> ground-truth narratives(e.g., sentences). Furthermore, as previous metrics such as METEOR (i.e., used in coarse-grained video caption task) DO NOT cope with fine-grained sports narrative task well, we hence develop a novel evaluation metric named Fine-grained Captioning Evaluation (FCE), which measures how accurate the generated linguistic description reflects fine-grained action details as well as the overall spatio-temporal interactional structure. Extensive experiments on our SVN dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework for fine-grained team sports video auto-narrative.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GameFlow: Narrative Visualization of NBA Basketball Games</title><link>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/gameflow-narrative-visualization-of-nba-basketball-games/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/gameflow-narrative-visualization-of-nba-basketball-games/</guid><description>&lt;p>Although basketball games have received broad attention, the forms of game reports and webcast are purely content-based cross-media: texts, videos, snapshots, and performance figures. Analytical narrations of games that seek to compose a complete game from heterogeneous datasets are challenging for general media producers because such a composition is time-consuming and heavily depends on domain experts. In particular, an appropriate analytical commentary of basketball games requires two factors, namely, rich context and domain knowledge, which includes game events, player locations, player profiles, and team profiles, among others. This type of analytical commentary elicits a timely and effective basketball game data visualization made up of different sources of media. Existing visualizations of basketball games mainly profile a particular aspect of the game. Therefore, this paper presents an expressive visualization scheme that comprehensively illustrates NBA games with three levels of details: a season level, a game level, and a session level. We reorganize a basketball game as a sequence of sessions to depict the game states and heated confrontations. We design and implement a live system that integrates multimedia NBA datasets: play-by-play text data, box score data, game video data, and action area data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme with case studies and user feedbacks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Generating commentaries for tennis videos</title><link>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/generating-commentaries-for-tennis-videos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/generating-commentaries-for-tennis-videos/</guid><description>&lt;p>We present an approach to automatically generating verbal commentaries for tennis games. We introduce a novel application that requires a combination of techniques from computer vision, natural language processing and machine learning. A video sequence is first analysed using state-of-the-art computer vision methods to track the ball, fit the detected edges to the court model, track the players, and recognise their strokes. Based on the recognised visual attributes we formulate the tennis commentary generation problem in the framework of long short-term memory recurrent neural networks as well as structured SVM. In particular, we investigate pre-embedding of descriptive terms and loss function for LSTM. We introduce a new dataset of 633 annotated pairs of tennis videos and corresponding commentary. We perform an automatic as well as human based evaluation, and demonstrate that the proposed pre-embedding and loss function lead to substantially improved accuracy of the generated commentary.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Generating Live Soccer-Match Commentary from Play Data</title><link>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/generating-live-soccer-match-commentary-from-play-data/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/generating-live-soccer-match-commentary-from-play-data/</guid><description>&lt;p>We address the task of generating live soccer-match commentaries from play event data. This task has characteristics that (i) each commentary is only partially aligned with events, (ii) play event data contains many types of categorical and numerical attributes, (iii) live commentaries often mention player names and team names. For these reasons, we propose an encoder for play event data, which is enhanced with a gate mechanism. We also introduce an attention mechanism on events. In addition, we introduced placeholders and their reconstruction mechanism to enable the model to copy appropriate player names and team names from the input data. We conduct experiments on the play data of the English Premier League, provide a discussion on the result including generated commentaries.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GOAL: A Challenging Knowledge-grounded Video Captioning Benchmark for Real-time Soccer Commentary Generation</title><link>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/goal-a-challenging-knowledge-grounded-video-captioning-benchmark-for-real-time-soccer-commentary-generation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/goal-a-challenging-knowledge-grounded-video-captioning-benchmark-for-real-time-soccer-commentary-generation/</guid><description>&lt;p>Despite the recent emergence of video captioning models, how to generate vivid, fine-grained video descriptions based on the background knowledge (i.e., long and informative commentary about the domain-specific scenes with appropriate reasoning) is still far from being solved, which however has great applications such as automatic sports narrative.

Machine learning has enabled systems to learn the process on its own in order to reduce the human labour. In sports like cricket, Football AI has not been used on a greater scale but there are certain areas where it can be of great help to apply AI techniques. In this paper the outcome classification task has been performed on cricket videos. The main purpose of performing such activities is to create automatic commentary generation. There are many sub-tasks needed to be considered for this task. One of those tasks is to classify the outcome of each ball for which commentary is to be generated. There has not been any standard data to perform such task, neither are any benchmark results to compare a new one. So in this paper, from data collection to performing the classification operation with results has been produced. There are four most general outcomes in the game of cricket such as Run, Dot, Boundary, Wicket. With the help of Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory Networks the outcome of cricket match ball by ball videos has been classified with 70% of test accuracy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scaling up SoccerNet with Multi-view Spatial Localization and Re-identification</title><link>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/scaling-up-soccernet-with-multi-view-spatial-localization-and-re-identification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/scaling-up-soccernet-with-multi-view-spatial-localization-and-re-identification/</guid><description>&lt;p>Soccer videos are a rich playground for computer vision, involving many elements, such as players, lines, and specific objects. Hence, to capture the richness of this sport and allow for fine automated analyses, we release SoccerNet-v3, a major extension of the SoccerNet dataset, providing a wide variety of spatial annotations and cross-view correspondences. SoccerNetâ€™s broadcast videos contain replays of important actions, allowing us to retrieve a same action from different viewpoints. We annotate those live and replay action frames showing same moments with exhaustive local information. Specifically, we label lines, goal parts, players, referees, teams, salient objects, jersey numbers, and we establish player correspondences between the views. This yields 1,324,732 annotations on 33,986 soccer images, making SoccerNet-v3 the largest dataset for multi-view soccer analysis. Derived tasks may benefit from these annotations, like camera calibration, player localization, team discrimination and multi-view re-identification, which can further sustain practical applications in augmented reality and soccer analytics. Finally, we provide Python codes to easily download our data and access our annotations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SOCCER: An Information-Sparse Discourse State Tracking Collection in the Sports Commentary Domain</title><link>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/soccer-an-information-sparse-discourse-state-tracking-collection-in-the-sports-commentary-domain/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/soccer-an-information-sparse-discourse-state-tracking-collection-in-the-sports-commentary-domain/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the pursuit of natural language understanding, there has been a long standing interest in tracking state changes throughout narratives. Impressive progress has been made in modeling the state of transaction-centric dialogues and procedural texts. However, this problem has been less intensively studied in the realm of general discourse where ground truth descriptions of states may be loosely defined and state changes are less densely distributed over utterances. This paper proposes to turn to simplified, fully observable systems that show some of these properties: Sports events. We curated 2,263 soccer matches including time-stamped natural language commentary accompanied by discrete events such as a team scoring goals, switching players or being penalized with cards. We propose a new task formulation where, given paragraphs of commentary of a game at different timestamps, the system is asked to recognize the occurrence of in-game events. This domain allows for rich descriptions of state while avoiding the complexities of many other real-world settings. As an initial point of performance measurement, we include two baseline methods from the perspectives of sentence classification with temporal dependence and current state-of-the-art generative model, respectively, and demonstrate that even sophisticated existing methods struggle on the state tracking task when the definition of state broadens or non-event chatter becomes prevalent.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SoccerNet-Caption: Dense Video Captioning for Soccer Broadcasts Commentaries</title><link>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/soccernet-caption-dense-video-captioning-for-soccer-broadcasts-commentaries/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/soccernet-caption-dense-video-captioning-for-soccer-broadcasts-commentaries/</guid><description>&lt;p>Soccer is more than just a game - it is a passion that transcends borders and unites people worldwide. From the roar of the crowds to the excitement of the commentators, every moment of a soccer match is a thrill. Yet, with so many games happening simultaneously, fans cannot watch them all live. Notifications for main actions can help, but lack the engagement of live commentary, leaving fans feeling disconnected. To fulfill this need, we propose in this paper a novel task of dense video captioning focusing on the generation of textual commentaries anchored with single times-tamps. To support this task, we additionally present a challenging dataset consisting of almost 37k timestamped commentaries across 715.9 hours of soccer broadcast videos. Additionally, we propose a first benchmark and baseline for this task, highlighting the difficulty of temporally anchoring commentaries yet showing the capacity to generate meaningful commentaries. By providing broadcasters with a tool to summarize the content of their video with the same level of engagement as a live game, our method could help satisfy the needs of the numerous fans who follow their team but cannot necessarily watch the live game. We believe our method has the potential to enhance the accessibility and understanding of soccer content for a wider audience, bringing the excitement of the game to more people.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SoccerNet-Echoes: A Soccer Game Audio Commentary Dataset</title><link>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/soccernet-echoes-a-soccer-game-audio-commentary-dataset/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/soccernet-echoes-a-soccer-game-audio-commentary-dataset/</guid><description>&lt;p>The application of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology in soccer enables sports analytics by extracting audio commentaries to provide insights into game events and facilitate automatic game understanding. This paper presents SoccerNet-Echoes, an extension of the SoccerNet dataset with automatically generated transcriptions of soccer game broadcasts. Generated using the Whisper model and translated with Google Translate into English when needed, these transcriptions enhance video content with textual information derived from game audio. SoccerNet-Echoes serves as a comprehensive resource for developing algorithms in action spotting, caption generation, and game summarization. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that combining modalitiesâ€”audio, video, and textâ€”yields mixed results on classification tasks. The combination of audio and video shows improved performance over individual modalities, while the addition of ASR text does not significantly enhance results. Additionally, our baseline summarization tasks indicate that ASR content enriches summaries, offering insights beyond event information. This multimodal dataset supports diverse applications, broadening the scope of research in sports analytics.

Specifically, we release around 300k annotations within SoccerNetâ€™s 500 untrimmed broadcast soccer videos. We extend current tasks in the realm of soccer to include action spotting, camera shot segmentation with boundary detection, and we define a novel replay grounding task. For each task, we provide and discuss benchmark results, reproducible with our open-source adapted implementations of the most relevant works in the field.

The dataset is composed of 500 complete soccer games from six main European leagues, covering three seasons from 2014 to 2017 and a total duration of 764 hours. A total of 6,637 temporal annotations are automatically parsed from online match reports at a one minute resolution for three main classes of events (Goal, Yellow/Red Card, and Substitution). As such, the dataset is easily scalable. These annotations are manually refined to a one second resolution by anchoring them at a single timestamp following well-defined soccer rules. With an average of one event every 6.9 minutes, this dataset focuses on the problem of localizing very sparse events within long videos. We define the task of spotting as finding the anchors of soccer events in a video. Making use of recent developments in the realm of generic action recognition and detection in video, we provide strong baselines for detecting soccer events. We show that our best model for classifying temporal segments of length one minute reaches a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 67.8%. For the spotting task, our baseline reaches an Average-mAP of 49.7% for tolerances d ranging from 5 to 60 seconds.

But the knowledge of commentator, however vast for a human being, is still limited relative to the total set of available stories. A major challenge is to narrate the most relevant stories (past incidents) based on the current (never-before-seen) game state. The paper proposes a solution which is an AI based approach that will assist the colour commentators in effective storytelling that is interesting to the audience, and related to what is actually happening in the game being broadcast.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TenniSet: A Dataset for Dense Fine-Grained Event Recognition, Localisation and Description</title><link>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/tenniset-a-dataset-for-dense-fine-grained-event-recognition-localisation-and-description/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/tenniset-a-dataset-for-dense-fine-grained-event-recognition-localisation-and-description/</guid><description>&lt;p>This paper introduces a new video understanding dataset which can be utilised for the related problems of event recognition, localisation and description in video. Our dataset consists of dense, well structured event annotations in untrimmed video of tennis matches. We also include highly detailed commentary style descriptions, which are heavily dependent on both the occurrence as well as the sequence of particular events. We use general deep learning techniques to acquire some initial baseline results on our dataset, without the need for explicit domain-specific assumptions.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

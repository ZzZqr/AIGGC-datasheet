<meta name=keywords content="Esports,FPS"><meta name=description content="Playing video games has been popular across all the age limits of modern society. In the beginning, it was limited among the younger community and it was just a hobby limited to individuals. Even though the majority of society sees video gaming as having a negative impact on society, this modern industry acts a significant role in healing the present competitive, stressful society. Game commentary has played a major role in the domain of competitive ESports. A proper game commentary is beneficial to both players and the audience. The aim of this project is to analyze the gameplays to produce a commentary track while balancing the contributing factors, color commentary, and play-by-play commentary. The project consists of three modules that perform the study in three perspectives: 1. Word sets related to action, spatial, temporal, and statistical information, 2. Word sets related to color commentary, 3. Word sets related to play-by-play commentary. In each module, a game commentary is generated using only the word sets related to that module. For evaluation, the similarity between the human commentary and the generated commentaries individually will be calculated."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/conceptual-representation-and-evaluation-of-an-fps-game-commentary-generator/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/AIGGC-datasheet/assets/css/stylesheet.6e3cae23ffdb771f23d63cb0f916b137936e5c06b0eed3ec4bc79a2b0809b644.css integrity rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/conceptual-representation-and-evaluation-of-an-fps-game-commentary-generator/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/conceptual-representation-and-evaluation-of-an-fps-game-commentary-generator/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Datasheet for Game Commentary Datasets"><meta property="og:title" content="Conceptual Representation and Evaluation of an FPS Game Commentary Generator"><meta property="og:description" content="Playing video games has been popular across all the age limits of modern society.

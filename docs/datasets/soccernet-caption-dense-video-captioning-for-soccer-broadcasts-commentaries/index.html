<meta name=keywords content="Sports,Soccer"><meta name=description content="Soccer is more than just a game - it is a passion that transcends borders and unites people worldwide. From the roar of the crowds to the excitement of the commentators, every moment of a soccer match is a thrill. Yet, with so many games happening simultaneously, fans cannot watch them all live. Notifications for main actions can help, but lack the engagement of live commentary, leaving fans feeling disconnected. To fulfill this need, we propose in this paper a novel task of dense video captioning focusing on the generation of textual commentaries anchored with single times-tamps. To support this task, we additionally present a challenging dataset consisting of almost 37k timestamped commentaries across 715.9 hours of soccer broadcast videos. Additionally, we propose a first benchmark and baseline for this task, highlighting the difficulty of temporally anchoring commentaries yet showing the capacity to generate meaningful commentaries. By providing broadcasters with a tool to summarize the content of their video with the same level of engagement as a live game, our method could help satisfy the needs of the numerous fans who follow their team but cannot necessarily watch the live game. We believe our method has the potential to enhance the accessibility and understanding of soccer content for a wider audience, bringing the excitement of the game to more people."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/soccernet-caption-dense-video-captioning-for-soccer-broadcasts-commentaries/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/AIGGC-datasheet/assets/css/stylesheet.6e3cae23ffdb771f23d63cb0f916b137936e5c06b0eed3ec4bc79a2b0809b644.css integrity rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/soccernet-caption-dense-video-captioning-for-soccer-broadcasts-commentaries/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/soccernet-caption-dense-video-captioning-for-soccer-broadcasts-commentaries/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Datasheet for Game Commentary Datasets"><meta property="og:title" content="SoccerNet-Caption: Dense Video Captioning for Soccer Broadcasts Commentaries"><meta property="og:description" content="Soccer is more than just a game - it is a passion that transcends borders and unites people worldwide.

<meta name=keywords content="Sports,Basketball"><meta name=description content="The emergence of video captioning makes it possible to automatically generate natural language description for a given video. However, generating detailed video descriptions that incorporate domain-specific information remains an unsolved challenge, holding significant research and application value, particularly in domains such as sports commentary generation. Moreover, sports event commentary goes beyond being a mere game report, it involves entertaining, metaphorical, and emotional descriptions. To promote the field of sports commentary automatic generation, in this paper, we introduce a novel dataset, the Basketball Highlight Commentary (BH-Commentary), comprising approximately 4K basketball highlight videos with groundtruth commentaries from professional commentators. In addition, we propose an end-to-end framework as a benchmark for basketball highlight commentary generation task, in which a lightweight and effective prompt strategy is designed to enhance alignment fusion among visual and textual features. Experimental results on the BH-Commentary dataset demonstrate the validity of the dataset and the effectiveness of the proposed benchmark for sports highlight commentary generation."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/a-descriptive-basketball-highlight-dataset-for-automatic-commentary-generation/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/AIGGC-datasheet/assets/css/stylesheet.6e3cae23ffdb771f23d63cb0f916b137936e5c06b0eed3ec4bc79a2b0809b644.css integrity rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/a-descriptive-basketball-highlight-dataset-for-automatic-commentary-generation/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://ZzZqr.github.io/AIGGC-datasheet/datasets/a-descriptive-basketball-highlight-dataset-for-automatic-commentary-generation/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Datasheet for Game Commentary Datasets"><meta property="og:title" content="A Descriptive Basketball Highlight Dataset for Automatic Commentary Generation"><meta property="og:description" content="The emergence of video captioning makes it possible to automatically generate natural language description for a given video.

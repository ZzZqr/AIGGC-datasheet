  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in natural language processing related to the real world, such as symbol grounding, language generation, and non-linguistic data search by natural language queries. Researchers usually collect pairs of text and non-text data for research. However, the text and non-text data are not always a {\textquotedblleft}true{\textquotedblright} pair. We focused on the shogi (Japanese chess) commentaries, which are accompanied by game states as a well-defined {\textquotedblleft}real world{\textquotedblright}. For analyzing and processing texts accurately, considering only the given states is insufficient, and we must consider the relationship between texts and the real world. In this paper, we propose {\textquotedblleft}Event Appearance{\textquotedblright} labels that show the relationship between events mentioned in texts and those happening in the real world. Our event appearance label set consists of temporal relation, appearance probability, and evidence of the event. Statistics of the annotated corpus and the experimental result show that there exists temporal relation which skillful annotators realize in common. However, it is hard to predict the relationship only by considering the given states.

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Aspect-based Sentiment Evaluation of Chess Moves ({ASSESS}): an {NLP}-based Method for Evaluating Chess Strategies from Textbooks
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The chess domain is well-suited for creating an artificial intelligence (AI) system that mimics real-world challenges, including decision-making. Throughout the years, minimal attention has been paid to investigating insights derived from unstructured chess data sources. In this study, we examine the complicated relationships between multiple referenced moves in a chess-teaching textbook, and propose a novel method designed to encapsulate chess knowledge derived from move-action phrases. This study investigates the feasibility of using a modified sentiment analysis method as a means for evaluating chess moves based on text. Our proposed Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) method represents an advancement in evaluating the sentiment associated with referenced chess moves. By extracting insights from move-action phrases, our approach aims to provide a more fine-grained and contextually aware {\textquoteleft}chess move’-based sentiment classification. Through empirical experiments and analysis, we evaluate the performance of our fine-tuned ABSA model, presenting results that confirm the efficiency of our approach in advancing aspect-based sentiment classification within the chess domain. This research contributes to the area of game-playing by machines and shows the practical applicability of leveraging NLP techniques to understand the context of strategic games. Keywords: Natural Language Processing, Chess, Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), Chess Move Evaluation.

    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Live commentaries are essential for enhancing spectators’ enjoyment and understanding during sports events or e-sports streams. We introduce a live audio commentator system designed specifically for a racing game, driven by the high demand in the e-sports field. While a player is playing a racing game, our system tracks real-time user play data including speed and steer rotations, and generates commentary to accompany the live stream. Human evaluation suggested that generated commentary enhances enjoyment and understanding of races compared to streams without commentary. Incorporating additional modules to improve diversity and detect irregular events, such as course-outs and collisions, further increases the preference for the output commentaries.

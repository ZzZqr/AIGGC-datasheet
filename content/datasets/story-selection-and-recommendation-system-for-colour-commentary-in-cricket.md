During a cricket match, commentary keeps the viewers entertained and updated about the game. Quoting relevant stories related to the current game scenario makes the game more interesting. But the knowledge of commentator, however vast for a human being, is still limited relative to the total set of available stories. A major challenge is to narrate the most relevant stories (past incidents) based on the current (never-before-seen) game state. The paper proposes a solution which is an AI based approach that will assist the colour commentators in effective storytelling that is interesting to the audience, and related to what is actually happening in the game being broadcast.

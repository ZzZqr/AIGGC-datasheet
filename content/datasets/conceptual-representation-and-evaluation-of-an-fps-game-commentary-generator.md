Playing video games has been popular across all the age limits of modern society. In the beginning, it was limited among the younger community and it was just a hobby limited to individuals. Even though the majority of society sees video gaming as having a negative impact on society, this modern industry acts a significant role in healing the present competitive, stressful society. Game commentary has played a major role in the domain of competitive ESports. A proper game commentary is beneficial to both players and the audience. The aim of this project is to analyze the gameplays to produce a commentary track while balancing the contributing factors, color commentary, and play-by-play commentary. The project consists of three modules that perform the study in three perspectives: 1. Word sets related to action, spatial, temporal, and statistical information, 2. Word sets related to color commentary, 3. Word sets related to play-by-play commentary. In each module, a game commentary is generated using only the word sets related to that module. For evaluation, the similarity between the human commentary and the generated commentaries individually will be calculated.

## Limitations

The presented information is accurate to the best of our knowledge with available documentation. While we aimed for a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of existing literature, it is impossible to guarantee the completeness. We are not the creators of the datasets and do not provide any endorsement or warranties. AIGGC can help reduce content production costs and supplement matches lacking professional commentators \cite{review66}. However, it inevitably introduces some negative societal impacts, such as human commentator displacement and misleading statements out of improper use and goverment of AI commentator.
